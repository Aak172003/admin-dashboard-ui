When tokens like accessToken or refreshToken are stored in cookies with the HttpOnly option enabled,
the frontend application cannot access these tokens from the cookies.

One alternative is to store tokens in localStorage instead of cookies.
However, there is a security problem: if we store data in localStorage, anyone can steal it by running a script.

The script would look like this: get value from localStorage (localStorage.getItem("key"))

If we store tokens in cookies, they are automatically sent with every request from the frontend.
