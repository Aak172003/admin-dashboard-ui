If anything gets stored in cookies like accessToken or refreshToken and it has the HttpOnly option enabled,
this means our frontend application cannot access those tokens from the cookies.

There is one alternative option -> we can store tokens not in cookies, but in localStorage instead.
But there is a problem here: if we store anything in localStorage, anyone can steal the data by running a script.

The script would be like -> get value from localStorage (localStorage.getItem("key"))
