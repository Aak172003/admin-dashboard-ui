If any thing get in cookies like accessToken or refreshToken and it have httponly option tick (enable) 
which means our frontend application can be able to access that token from the cookies 


There is one option -> we stored tokens not in cookies , we are going to store in localStorage 
But there is problem here , if we store anything in localstorage , so anyone can theift the data to run script 

Script was like -> get value from localastorage (localstorage.getItem("key"))
